  <p>See console for output.</p>
  <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
  <ul>
    <li> I think I got the array built-in fuction operating, but I definitely don't really understand it.</li>
    <li> Wondering if it is better to reorganize my code and tests into unified, separate blocks. </li>
    <li> I re-filled the cart after the empty function in order to make the stretch concepts functional. Would there have been another way to do this? </li>
    <li> Previous logs of the array, following the application of the removeItem function, also show the change (the removal of the first item). Is there a way to avoid this/is this problematic/I'm sure it depends? </li>
</ul>
